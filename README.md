# tableau-challenge
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
In this challenge, I was able to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total) with a timespan of Nov 2019 through Oct 2020. 
The following are some questions I wish to tackle:
How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
What are the peak hours in which bikes are used?
Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey and ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
How does the average trip duration change by age?
What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
